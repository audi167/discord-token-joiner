# Discord Server Joiner


BotterTool is a simple python based discord tool to let tokens join a specific server. You can operate everything very simply. Everything is self-explanatory. Since there are not many such tools on Github and co. that everyone needs, I now publish the tool from [Boost4u](https://boost4u.xyz/).
